    <p>
      The Conlang Engine is intended for the beginning
      conlanger to create a new constructed language.
      The features are currently limited to creating a
      phonology (sound system) and a basic dictionary.
      However, I hope to be able to expand this site with
      more advanced features as time allows.

      Once you have created a language, you can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add and sounds (or phonemes) to your language</li>
      <li>Add, edit, and remove words and their translations</li>
    </ul>
